# ChangeCMS

Change is a lightweight NodeJS CMS platform built with Meteor. It is easily integrated into existing Meteor applications and websites. Change provides a simple solution for those developers who work with Node to provide their clients with an easy interface for them to make changes.

The goal is to support a wide range of web-admin features including e-commerce, blogging, analytics and social media management. All from one panel!

## Features
- Modifications trigger live updates across all currently connected browsers. No need for a refresh for everyone connected to see the new updates!
- Mobile UI for use across devices.
- Store all website data in MongoDB collections, allowing you to extend functionality later on and easily add new dynamic content.
- Simple includes for existing websites to allow modification. Will require data insertion into database manually however.
- Currently includes demo site.

## Current Status
Short term roadmap as of 18/10/15
- Authentication and login 			  [✓]
- Storing site text in database		[✓]
- Draw site text from database		[✓]
- Modify text across each page		[✓]
- Modify images across pages      [ ]
- Allow external image URL's      [ ]
- Modify images across each page	[ ]

Long term roadmap includes analytics/data gathering, social media management and a form of ecommerce management implementation. I also aim to add in dynamic content hooks so you can make blog-esque posts and gather info from the API.

Not currently usable. Working on a stable, function build. Below is a screenshot of the current UI.

## Installation
Currently must be downloaded and manually factored into an existing site or a new site built on top of it. Allows for easy hooks to be placed instead-of or around existing content. This will be streamlined in the future when core functionality reaches a releasable version.
Through AtmosphereJS upon completion.
