# ChangeCMS

Change is a lightweight NodeJS CMS platform built with Meteor. It is easily integrated into existing Meteor applications and websites. Change provides a simple solution for those developers who work with Node to provide their clients with an easy interface for them to make changes.

## Features
- Modifications trigger live updates across all currently connected browsers. No need for a refresh for everyone connected to see the new updates!
- Mobile UI for use across devices.
- Store all website data in MongoDB collections, allowing you to extend functionality later on and easily add new dynamic content.
- Simple includes for existing websites to allow modification. Will require data insertion into database manually however.
- Currently includes demo site.

## Current Status

Not currently usable. Working on a stable, function build. Below is a screenshot of the current UI.

## Installation
Currently must be downloaded and manually factored into an existing site or a new site built on top of it. This will be streamlined in the future when core functionality reaches a releasable version.
Through AtmosphereJS upon completion.
